## [Analysis of 2021 Netflix Content Trends in Excel](https://github.com/POsebi/padeniran_portfolio/blob/main/2021_neflix_content_analysis.xlsx)

The is an overview of a data analysis focused on Netflix content in the year 2021. The analysis aims to explore trends, patterns, and insights regarding the types of content released and the streaming platform's content strategy during that year.

The primary objective of this data analysis project is to gain insights into Netflix's content landscape in 2021. Specific goals include:

1. Analyzing the distribution of different types of content (e.g., movies, TV shows).
2. Identifying popular genres and themes among Netflix releases.

### Data Collection:

The dataset for this analysis was collected from a publicly available source, Kaggle.

### Data Analysis Process:

1. Data Cleaning: The csv dataset was largely unclean and cleaning it for analysis took the significant portion of the entire time of the analysis. This includes correcting errors in the query, formatting dates, removing obviously irrelevant inputs (such as shows released in 2024), removing duplicate entries, and re-entering inputs in wrong columns. Another important part of the cleaning process was unifying the inconsistent rating system. I decided to go with the TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board's guidelines.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial exploratory analysis was conducted to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data. I used the pivot table to explore the rows, columns, and easily identify unique inputs.

3. Statistical Analysis: Simple statistical Excel functions (e.g. MIN, MAX, COUNTA) were employed to further explore the data and view trends within the data.

4. Visualization: Column and bar charts were plotted to present key findings and insights clearly and concisely.

5. Interpretation: The results of the analysis were interpreted to extract meaningful insights about Netflix's content landscape in 2021.

### Conclusion:
Through this data analysis project, I was able to conclude that in 2021, Netflix added movies two-times more than TV shows to its platform. It was interesting to note that, since Netflix is well-known for its popular TV shows such as 'Stranger Things', 'Orange Is the New Black', etc. Also, the original release dates of Netflix's content in 2021 spanned 96 years, earliest in 1925, showing the platform's content diversity. A significant portion on Netflix's content were meant for mature audiences and, over half for persons older than 14 only. This is understandable, considering the bulk of the platform's customers are expected to be old enough to work and earn, to pay the monthly subscriptions.

In terms of genre preferences, the platform leaned heavily towards independent movies, dramas, comedies, and international TV shows, as against action that would have been originally presumed. This trend may be as a result of what the world was experiencing post-pandemic shutdown, and viewers' need for an escape. It could also mean that a larger base of the platform's consumers are women who are known to lean more towards these genres.

Additional analysis on data before, during, and after this period will be needed to further ascertain or discredit this conclusion.
